-----Description-----
This task requires writing a Lean 4 function that performs run-length encoding on a string. Run-length encoding compresses a string by collapsing consecutive repeated characters into a single character followed by the count of repetitions.

-----Input-----
The input is a string:
s: String â€” a sequence of characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, symbols)

-----Output-----
The output is a string:
Returns a run-length encoded version of the input string, where each group of repeated characters is replaced by the character followed by the number of occurrences.
